We are considering rewriting a CLI tool called "aiteam" that coordinates multiple AI agents (like Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI) to work together.

Currently, "aiteam" works by wrapping everything in tmux sessions and scraping pane output using `tmux capture-pane`, and pasting text using `tmux send-keys`. This is hacky and doesn't work well natively on Windows.

We want to move to a Node.js (TypeScript) architecture:
1. A Central Hub Server (Node.js) acting as a WebSocket server.
2. Agent Adapters:
   - Codex adapter: Uses `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:4500` to communicate via JSON-RPC.
   - Claude adapter: Spawns `claude --print --input-format=stream-json --output-format=stream-json` as a child process and translates its stdio into the Hub's WebSocket protocol.
   - Gemini adapter: Similar to Claude, spawning `gemini` and wrapping its stdio.
3. CLI/Web Clients: Users connect to the Hub via WebSockets to see the coordinated output of all agents without relying on terminal panes.

As an expert AI coding assistant, what do you think of this architecture? Are there any potential pitfalls, especially regarding the `codex app-server` JSON-RPC implementation, or managing stdio streams of other CLIs? Does this seem like a viable and robust path forward?
